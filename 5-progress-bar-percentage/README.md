### Things to learn

**Progressbar foreground div**

- Add `role="progressbar"` to `div` of **progressbar foreground**. Remember, whenever you use div, always try to use role on that to make it accessible.

- Add `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, and `aria-valuemax` to `div` of **progressbar foreground**.
