`Asked in first round at a company`

`Approx time needed - 30 minutes`

## üìù Transaction List React Challenge

This repository contains a **React coding challenge** based on a first-round interview question at a company. The challenge focuses on rendering data, working with state, and simple data manipulation.

---

## Part 1 ‚Äì Display Transactions

**Objective:**

Render a list of transactions in the format:

`<Customer Name>: <Amount>`

---

## Part 2 ‚Äì Find Highest Balance Customer

Identify the customer with the highest net balance (sum of all their transactions) and highlight their name in the UI.

---

## Part 3 ‚Äì Filter Transactions (Not doing this in here in this question)

Filter the list of transactions in real-time based on user input. The displayed list should update as the user types.

Data

```ts
const transactions = [
  { id: "t_01", customer: "Alice Johnson", amount: 120 },
  { id: "t_02", customer: "Bob Smith", amount: 50 },
  { id: "t_03", customer: "Cathy Lee", amount: 75 },
  { id: "t_04", customer: "David Kim", amount: 40 },
  { id: "t_05", customer: "Alice Johnson", amount: -30 },
  { id: "t_06", customer: "Alice Johnson", amount: 60 },
  { id: "t_07", customer: "David Kim", amount: 90 },
  { id: "t_08", customer: "Ethan Brown", amount: 200 },
  { id: "t_09", customer: "Cathy Lee", amount: 25 },
  { id: "t_10", customer: "Bob Smith", amount: 80 },
  { id: "t_11", customer: "David Kim", amount: -10 },
  { id: "t_12", customer: "Ethan Brown", amount: -150 },
  { id: "t_13", customer: "Alice Johnson", amount: 45 },
  { id: "t_14", customer: "Fiona Green", amount: 55 },
];
```
