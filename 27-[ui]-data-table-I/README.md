# Data table I

`Approx time - 20m`

## Things learnt

- How to create table?
- Style the table - `border-collapse:collapse` prop on table to get rid of double border
- `flex` vs `inline-flex`

### `flex` vs `inline-flex`

Notice, for `pages` style we use `display: inline-flex`. Whereas, for the outer `pagination` (parent of `pages`), we use `display: flex`.

**When to use inline-flex?**

- Use `display: flex` when you want the flex container to occupy its own line and take up the full available width, managing its children with flexbox.

- Use `display: inline-flex` when you want the flex container to be part of an inline flow, sitting next to other elements on the same line, while still managing its children with flexbox.
