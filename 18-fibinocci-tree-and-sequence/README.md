## Fibinocci Sequence and tree generation

Fibinocci number find - `Approx time - 10 minutes`
Fibinocci tree generation - `Approx time - 10 minutes`

**_May be asked in companies like IBM_**

This involves solving the following:

- Find fibinocci number through recursion
- Find fibinocci number through loops
- Optimize the above
- Function to generate fibinocci series (not just return the number but return back the whole series)
- Function to generate fibinocci tree that prints the above generated sequence into number of rows the user wants
