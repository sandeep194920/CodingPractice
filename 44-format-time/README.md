## Format Time

`Approx time - 15m`

This is a pre-requisite of [StopWatch](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/stopwatch/react?framework=react&tab=coding) question. Complete this first before attempting [StopWatch](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/stopwatch/react?framework=react&tab=coding).

This question teaches you how to format time give in `ms` into `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds` and `milliseconds` format.

### Main Idea

Think in the lines where, first we take out hours from the milliseconds. Remaining milliseconds will be the minutes. Then take out minutes and format it - remaining will be seconds. Take out seconds and format it, and the remaining will be milliseconds.
