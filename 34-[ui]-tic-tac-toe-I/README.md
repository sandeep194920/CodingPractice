# [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.greatfrontend.com/questions/user-interface/tic-tac-toe/react?framework=react&tab=coding)

`Approx time - 25m`

First refer to [tic-tac-toe board ui](https://github.com/sandeep194920/CodingPractice/tree/main/04-%5Bui%5D-tic-tac-toe-board-ui)

Unlike [4-Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/sandeep194920/CodingPractice/blob/main/04-%5Bui%5D-tic-tac-toe-board-ui/src/App.css) where we used a matrix style, we just use linear array here for board. So if the interviewer asks tic-tac-toe question, just ask a clarifying question that are we going to scale this in the future to add more squares to make it 4X4 or something. If answer is yes, then go for a 2D matrix. If no, then stick to 1D array.
