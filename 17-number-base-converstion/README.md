`Approx time - 10 minutes for each question`

**_May be asked in companies like IBM_**

This involves solving the following base conversions

- Decimal to binary
- Binary to decimal
- Decimal to octal
- Octal to decimal

For each problem, in `code.ts` file, we will walk through manual method of solving and convert that to the code easily. We will also identify a pattern where our code is the exact match to our manual walkthrough. We also identify where the loops to be used, based on repetitive pattern we come across.
