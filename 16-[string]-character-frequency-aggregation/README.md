## Character frequency aggregation

Asked at IBM first round (got from resources)

`Approx time - 10 minutes`

Sort the unique characters alphabetically.

Output a new compressed string where each unique character is followed by its total aggregated frequency.

```
input = a3b2c5g1g9c2
output = a3b2c7g10

rationale - The character 'c' appears twice (c5 and c2), so its total frequency is c5 + c2 = c7. The character 'g' appears twice (g1 and g9), so its total frequency is g1 + g9 = g10. The output must be sorted alphabetically.

```
